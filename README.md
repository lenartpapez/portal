### About

This was a thesis project made for requirements of the local national institute of public health which my mentor was working with at the time. Stack: Laravel, Vue (admin panel), bootstrap (yuck), MySQL.

## How to

Clone the repo and run ```composer install``` and ```npm install```. Host the app with Laravel Valet and change .env.example to .env with appropriate settings (you will need to establish a local database).
